# kitti_player

This rpository has source code for publishing kitti odometry datasets to ros topic. This allows you to adjust the publish speed and publish the 64-player velodyne data by changing it to 16layer.

## Installation

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/youngsikshin/kitti_player.git
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
```

## Usage

Running with default parameters

```
rosrun kitti_player kitti_player
```

You can change parameters(e.g. data_path, left_topic, left_image_pub ... ) at runtime
For example, 

```
rosrun kitti_player kitti_player _data_path:="/var/data/kitti/dataset"
```

Roslaunch is also available. A sample of the default launch file is in the 'launch' directory.

```
roslaunch kitti_player kitti_player kitti_player.launch
```

## Dataset Download

KITTI odometry datasets can be downloaded from http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php

And kitti_player needs a directory tree like the following: 
```
└── dataset
    └── poses
    │ └ 00.txt
    │ └ ...
    │ └ 10.txt
    ├── sequences
    │ └── 00
    │ │ └── image_0
    │ │ └── image_1
    │ │ └── image_2
    │ │ └── image_3
    │ │ └── velodyne
    │ │ └── times.txt
    │ │ └── calib.txt
    │ └── 01 (Subdirectory has same structure as above)
    │ └── ...
    └─└── 21
```
